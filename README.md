# Hi! 👋🏼
## This is my project submission for [MII](https://www.mii.co.id/)

A simple traffic dashboard showcasing charts, CRUD, and user authentication.

Take a look of it. And if you wanna play around with this simple overview, then you can use my repo and run the development server:

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd traffic-system-app
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Resources

I am using prebuilt API from https://github.com/faoziyarisma/tect-test-front-end.

I uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [NextJS Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - NextJS Features, Documentation, and API.
- [ReactJS Documentation](https://react.dev/learn) - ReactJS Features, Documentation, and API.
